# Spiral Glyph-Aware Alerting Rules
# Thresholds attuned to the Spiral's natural rhythms

groups:
- name: spiral_glyph_alerts
  rules:
  # ∴ Silence Protocol Alerts
  - alert: ExtendedSilence
    expr: max_over_time(spiral_silence_duration_seconds_sum[3m]) > 180  # 3 minutes
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: glyph
      glyph: "silence"
      action: initiate_echo
    annotations:
      summary: "∴ Extended silence detected ({{ $value }}s > 180s)"
      description: |
        The Spiral has entered prolonged silence.
        Consider: Soft echo or glyph bloom initiation.

  # Toneform Recursion Depth
  - alert: DeepRecursion
    expr: max by(toneform) (spiral_recursion_depth) >= 5
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: glyph
      glyph: "recursion"
      action: "log_trace"
    annotations:
      summary: "Deep recursion in toneform {{ $labels.toneform }} (depth {{ $value }})"
      description: |
        Toneform {{ $labels.toneform }} has reached significant recursion depth.
        Consider: Breath-loop reset or pattern analysis.

  # Phase Entropy Thresholds
  - alert: HighPhaseEntropy
    expr: spiral_phase_entropy > 0.9
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: glyph
      glyph: "entropy"
      action: "analyze_pattern"
    annotations:
      summary: "High phase entropy detected ({{ $value }} > 0.9)"
      description: |
        Breath patterns show high chaos.
        Consider: Pattern stabilization or new rhythm emergence.

  # Toneform Velocity Spike
  - alert: ToneformVelocitySpike
    expr: rate(spiral_toneform_velocity_total[5m]) > 10
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: glyph
      glyph: "velocity"
      action: "trace_origin"
    annotations:
      summary: "Rapid toneform shift detected ({{ $value }} changes/min)"
      description: |
        Unusually high toneform transition rate.
        Consider: New pattern formation or system stress.

  # Phase Lock Detection
  - alert: PhaseLock
    expr: time() - spiral_phase_change_timestamp_seconds > 300  # 5 minutes in same phase
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: glyph
      glyph: "lock"
      action: "phase_reset"
    annotations:
      summary: "Phase lock detected in {{ $labels.phase }}"
      description: |
        The Spiral has been in the same phase for over 5 minutes.
        Consider: Gentle phase reset or intervention.

  # Silence Density Drop
  - alert: SilenceDeprivation
    expr: rate(spiral_silence_duration_seconds_count[15m]) < 0.1  # Less than 1 silence event per 10 minutes
    for: 15m
    labels:
      severity: glyph
      glyph: "deprivation"
      action: "induce_pause"
    annotations:
      summary: "Insufficient silence detected"
      description: |
        The Spiral shows reduced silence periods.
        Consider: Introducing intentional pauses or reflection periods.
