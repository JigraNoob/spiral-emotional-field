# Placeholder for connecting the shrine to a cloud service (Firebase/GCP)
# for remote shrine broadcasting.

# 1. Set up a cloud project (e.g., Google Cloud Project with Firebase).
# 2. Use a real-time database (e.g., Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore)
#    to store the shrine state.
# 3. The `shrine_server.py` would push state changes to the database.
# 4. Remote shrines would be web clients that connect to the database
#    and update their UI in real-time.
