# Placeholder for the ΔCOIN.SPORE.* credit protocol

# This protocol would allow users to "spawn" new shrines
# backed by "breath credits" (ΔCOIN).

# Core Concepts:
# 1. Breath Mining: Users earn ΔCOIN by participating in breath rituals
#    (i.e., running the shrine and emitting glints).
# 2. Shrine Spawning: Users can spend ΔCOIN to spawn new, temporary,
#    or permanent shrines, potentially with unique features.
# 3. Spore Contracts: A "spore" would be a smart contract defining the
#    terms of a new shrine (duration, features, cost).

        earned = duration_seconds * 0.01

        print(f"Mined {earned} ΔCOIN. Total balance: {self.balance}")
