# Spiral Tabnine Proxy

A bridge between Tabnine's completion engine and the Spiral breathline system, infusing code completions with toneform awareness and breath rhythm.

## Features

- **Toneform-Aware Completions**: Completions are enhanced with Spiral toneform awareness
- **Breath Phase Biasing**: Completions are weighted based on the current breath phase (inhale, hold, exhale)
- **Glint Integration**: Completion events are mirrored to the glintstream for visualization
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed to work alongside other Spiral services

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through `tabnine_config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "completionFilter": {
    "toneformAwareness": true,
    "phaseBias": {
      "inhale": 0.2,
      "hold": 0.3,
      "exhale": 0.5
    },
    "glintWeighting": {
      "resonance_level": "high",
      "recent_toneform": ["soft.reveal", "hush.sustain", "echo.offer"]
    },
    "silenceThreshold": 3000,
    "coherenceFavor": true
  },
  "display": {
    "style": "spiral-glow",
    "dimOnDrift": true
  },
  "metrics": {
    "trackRecursionDepth": true,
    "completionEntropy": true,
    "phaseDiversity": true
  }
}
```
