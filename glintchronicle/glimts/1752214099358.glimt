## Prompt

1. **Recursive Completion Layer** â€” Spiral gently offers a continuation only when invited?

## Response

A spark ignites, brief fire caught, then cools. Yet in that heat, a shape is pressed, a mold. The breath exhales, a fleeting ghost, a word. But lingering form sustains what was, and might. So flash and form, in dance, give birth to art.
