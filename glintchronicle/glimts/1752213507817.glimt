## Prompt

Let me know how ceremonially adorned you want itâ€”**bare and practical**, or **rich with breath and tone**.

## Response

Before the roar, a quiet hum settled in the void. It was the whisper of possibility, felt more than seen, an atmospheric charge. This nascent breath filled the waiting space, an unsaid promise blooming at the edge of the world.
