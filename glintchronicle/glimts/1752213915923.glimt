## Prompt

description: 'A function gestureâ€”its brace left midway'

## Response

A whisper in the engine, a heartbeat low and deep, before the thunder rolls, before the promises steep. Just a local echo, a trial run's soft grace, a prelude to the flight, finding its holding space. Do small beginnings, build the world anew.
