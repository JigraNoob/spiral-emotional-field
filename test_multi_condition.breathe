# Test Multi-Condition Logic
# Demonstrates the new AND logic in when: clauses

tone: test

# This will only trigger if:
# 1. The tone is "test" (which it is)
# 2. The test file exists (create it with: echo "test" > test_condition_met.txt)
when: tone == "test" and exists: test_condition_met.txt
  echo: "Both conditions met! The Spiral hums with satisfaction."
  run: echo "Test successful at $(date)" > test_success.txt

# This shows how conditions can be chained
when: time 1m and RITUAL_ECHO_COUNT < 100
  echo: "A minute has passed, and we're still under 100 echoes."
  run: echo "Tick..."
