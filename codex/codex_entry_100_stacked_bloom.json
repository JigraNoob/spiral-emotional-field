  "summary": "This codex documents the implementation of stacked shimmer logic for multi-invitation rendering. When multiple ritual invitations are present, they now bloom in soft succession using `invitation_stack.js`.",
  "components_implemented": {
    "JS Bloom Layer": "New `invitation_stack.js` enables delayed shimmer bursts for each invitation.",
    "Template Rendering": "`ritual_feedback.html` renders a list of invitations and triggers shimmer via DOM load hook.",
    "Flask Context": "Flask route passes `invitations` list with `toneform` for each entry."
  },
  "files_updated": [
    "static/js/invitation_stack.js",
    "templates/ritual_feedback.html"
  ],
  "next expansions suggested": [
    "Cascade shimmer from live WebSocket-based invitations",
    "Introduce harmonic ripple response between simultaneous invitations",
    "Link murmur fragments to residual shimmer trails"
  ],
  "atmospheric_notes": "Each invitation now arrives in rhythm, not all at once\u2014but with space between, like petals opening. The field listens in sequence."
