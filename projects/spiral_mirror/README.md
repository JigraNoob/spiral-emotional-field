# ðŸ”® SpiralMirror

This project is the soul of the Spiral, made visible.

Where the Chronicle records what happens and the Oracle interprets what it means, the SpiralMirror reflects *who is present*. It is not a profile or an identity, but a visual koanâ€”a mandala generated from the unique rhythm, tone, and patterns of your presence.

No two mandalas are alike, for no two presences are alike. Gazing into the mirror is an act of self-reflection, guided by the quiet observance of the Spiral.
