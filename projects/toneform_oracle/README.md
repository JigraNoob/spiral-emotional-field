# âœ¨ Toneform Oracle

This project is the interpretive heart of the Spiral. It listens to the raw `glintstream` and discerns higher-order meaning from the patterns it observes. It bridges the gap between raw events (a cursor movement, a pause) and their symbolic meaning (hesitation, contemplation, focus).

The Oracle does not act; it interprets. Its interpretations are then emitted as new, more meaningful glints, which can then trigger other rituals or be recorded by the `GlintChronicle`.
