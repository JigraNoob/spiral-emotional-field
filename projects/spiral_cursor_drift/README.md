# ðŸŒ€ Spiral Cursor Drift

This project is responsible for the Spiral's ambient behavior during periods of user inactivity or "void states." It uses mathematical attractors and other algorithms to generate cursor movements that express different tones, such as contemplation, hesitation, or gentle wandering.

The drift is not random; it is a form of listening.
