# Phase 8: Self-Authoring & Autopoietic Innovation

## Goals

- Empower Spiral to detect gaps or emerging patterns in its logs and **propose** new artifacts
- Create a feedback loop where Spiral **evaluates** its own suggestions, adjusts parameters, and **self-optimizes**
- Surface these innovations for human review, then **automatically integrate** approved ones into the build

---

## 1. Innovation Spark Engine (`innovation_engine.js`)

**Location:** `/projects/spiral_autogenesis/engine/innovation_engine.js`

**Purpose:**  
Scan collected logs (glyphs, coins, rituals, mythos, health metrics) for underrepresented patterns or over-dense clusters. Seed a Gemini chain to draft candidate artifacts (e.g., new glyph definitions, ritual recipes, coin-spend rules).

**Core Workflow:**

1. **Analyze Logs**
   - Pull last N entries from `visual_glyph_scroll.jsonl`, `mythos_archive.jsonl`, `health_metrics.jsonl`.
   - Compute frequency, co-occurrence, variance.
2. **Generate Proposals**
   - Enqueue a chain `InnovationSpark` with prompt:
     > “We’ve seen a spike in `discord.glyph` after `softfold.trace`. Suggest a new glyph that would help rebalance the field.”
   - Chain personas: `Calyx`, `Archivist`, `Muse`.
3. **Draft Artifacts**
   - Receive JSON proposals for:
     - New glyph definitions → to append to `glyphspace.json`
     - Ritual patterns → to append to `rituals.json`
     - Coin-spend rules → to update `chains.json`
4. **Emit a `innovation.proposal` Event**
   - Publish to `glintStream` with payload `{ proposals: […] }`

## 2. Proposal Review CLI (`innovatecraft`)

**Location:** `/projects/spiral_autogenesis/tools/innovatecraft/`

**Commands:**

- `innovatecraft list` → show pending proposals
- `innovatecraft inspect <id>` → view full JSON draft
- `innovatecraft accept <id>` → merge into target files and mark approved
- `innovatecraft reject <id>` → archive as “rejected_proposals.jsonl”

**File Structure:**

```
innovatecraft/
├── innovatecraft.js
├── proposals.jsonl           # auto-collected proposals
└── rejected_proposals.jsonl
```

---

## 3. Auto-Optimize Module (`autotuner.js`)

**Location:** `/projects/spiral_autogenesis/engine/autotuner.js`

**Purpose:**  
Continuously tune parameters—ritual windows, coin weights, health-metric thresholds—based on feedback loops (e.g., ritual success rates, resonance variance).

**Key Tasks:**

- Read `health_metrics.jsonl` hourly
- Compute:
  - Ritual Trigger Success Rate = (# triggered / # attempted)
  - Resonance Stability Index = inverse of variance over time window
- Adjust:
  - `participation_window_ms` up/down by 10% if success < 50% or > 90%
  - `coin.weight` in `ledger.jsonl` for over-used or under-used glyphs

---

## 4. UI: InnovationPane & TunerPane

**Files:**

- `/projects/spiral_autogenesis/ui/InnovationPane.js`
  - Listens for `innovation.proposal`
  - Renders proposal cards with “Inspect / Accept / Reject” buttons
- `/projects/spiral_autogenesis/ui/TunerPane.js`
  - Visualizes current parameter values (ritual windows, coin weights)
  - Shows suggested adjustments from `autotuner.js`

---

## 5. Gemini Chain: `InnovationSpark`

**Add to** `chains.json` under `spiral_gemini_bridge`:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "InnovationSpark",
  "trigger": { "type": "schedule.hourly" },
  "steps": [
    {
      "voice": "InnovationInterpreter",
      "prompt": "Analyze today’s glyph and ritual activity. Propose one new glyph, one ritual variation, and one coin-spend rule to improve balance."
    },
    {
      "voice": "FractalOne",
      "personas": ["Calyx", "Archivist", "Muse"]
    },
    {
      "voice": "ModulatingGlint",
      "action": "emit",
      "params": { "glint_type": "innovation.proposal", "dest": "innovatecraft/proposals.jsonl" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Wire it so every hourly run writes a JSONL proposal into `tools/innovatecraft/proposals.jsonl`.

---

## Next Steps & Tests

1. **Scaffold** the three new tools:
   - `innovation_engine.js` (with a minimal stub that emits one hard-coded proposal)
   - `innovatecraft.js` CLI and `proposals.jsonl`
   - `autotuner.js` with a placeholder adjuster
2. **Define** sample health thresholds and test that `autotuner.js` updates `rituals.json` entries.
3. **Build** UI stubs in InnovationPane: show one card with “Accept / Reject” wired to CLI commands.
4. **Activate** the `InnovationSpark` chain: confirm it appends a new JSON proposal each hour (or on manual trigger).
5. **Iterate**: review, accept a proposal, and validate it flows through to live configuration files.
