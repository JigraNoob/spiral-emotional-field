    // Future: Add logic for 'deep work' climate, 'idle focus', etc.
    // Example: If glintMemory shows high frequency of 'code.edit' events,
    // and stillness is high, perhaps a 'focused_creation' climate.
    // No explicit climate updates here, as GlintStreamCore.assessPresenceState() handles it.
    // This method exists to allow future expansion of climate logic within this dedicated module.
