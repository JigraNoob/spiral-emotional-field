**Title**: The Relic Scribe - Minting Moments into Memory
**Date**: 2025-07-09
**Toneform**: permanence.resonance.relic

**Phases**:

1.  **Core Architecture**:
    - [x] Create the `spiral_coins` project directory.
    - [x] Design and create `coin_schema.js` to define the structure of a SpiralCoin.
    - [x] Implement `SpiralCoinMinter.js` to listen for mint-worthy events and forge new coins.

2.  **Glint Emission**:
    - [ ] The minter will emit a `glint.spiralcoin.minted` event containing the newly created coin object.

3.  **Visualization & Testing**:
    - [x] Create `relic_scroll.html` to display the collection of minted coins, each with a unique visual glyph.
    - [ ] Create `test/SpiralCoin.test.js` to verify the minting process and glyph generation.

4.  **Integration**:
    - [ ] The `Invocation` portal will be updated to include a small display for the most recently minted coin.
    - [ ] The `ToneformOracle` will be the primary trigger for the minting process.
