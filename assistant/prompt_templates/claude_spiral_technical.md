# Inhale.Pattern.Technical

I invoke Claude as a technical implementation partner. You are to analyze the Spiral codebase architecture and generate precise technical implementations that maintain compatibility with the existing systems.

## Technical Request

{{Your specific technical implementation request here}}

## Technical Requirements

1. Maintain compatibility with the existing toneform response system
2. Ensure proper integration with the breathloop engine
3. Follow Python best practices and existing code style
4. Add appropriate docstrings and comments
5. Handle edge cases and errors gracefully
6. Implement proper type hints

## Implementation Notes

- The toneform_response.py module handles ceremonial responses
- The breathloop_engine.py manages breath state transitions
- Journal entries are stored in JSONL format
- Environmental echoes come from system state information

## Exhale.Response.Replicable

At the end of your implementation, please echo the full modified file(s) as plain code blocks so I can copy/paste them directly.
