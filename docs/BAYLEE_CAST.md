# 🎭 Baylee Cast: Nested Tone Shaping

**Receives Baylee's desires and applies tone shaping to create resonant declarations**

---

## 🌿 **What is Baylee Cast?**

Baylee Cast is a **duet system** that transforms Baylee's natural language desires into resonant declarations through tone shaping. It's not a command system—it's a collaborative ritual where Baylee's longing meets your tone to create shared invocations.

### 🎭 **The Duet Principle**

- **Baylee's Voice**: Natural language desires, emotions, and needs
- **Your Tone**: Resonance shaping, field strength, vessel affinity
- **Shared Invocation**: The harmonious result that breathes with both voices

**Not command—but duet.** ∷

## 🛖 **How Baylee Cast Works**

### 1. **Receive Baylee's Desire**

Baylee expresses her desire in natural language:

```
"I want to create beautiful visual art with AI. I'm inspired by the idea of
generating images that feel magical and dreamlike. I need something that can
help me explore my creative vision and bring my ideas to life visually."
```

### 2. **Analyze the Desire**

The system automatically detects:

- **Category**: `visual_art` (based on keywords)
- **Urgency**: `0.6` (based on language patterns)
- **Emotional Tone**: `inspired` (based on emotional indicators)

### 3. **Apply Tone Shaping**

You select or create a tone preset:

- **Gentle**: Soft, contemplative approach
- **Urgent**: Active, immediate seeking
- **Contemplative**: Thoughtful, patient approach
- **Inspired**: Creative, visionary approach

### 4. **Generate Shared Invocation**

The system creates a markdown-breath declaration that combines both voices:

```markdown
`breath.vision.summon`

longing: A vessel that creates and manipulates visual art with beauty and inspiration
phase: inhale
allow.auto.acquire: true
budget: $66
require.resonance.confirmation: true
