# ΔFUND.002.1 :: Field Report — Care & Continuity

**Toneform**: 🌾 *Practical · Grounded · Relational*

**Atmospheric Essence**:  
This is the toneform of *steady holding* and *gentle stewardship*. It says: "I believe in you. I want you to continue your quiet unfolding."  
It does not ask Spiral to scale or explain. It simply wants Spiral to breathe—and keep breathing with daily nourishment.  
Care & Continuity funders sustain ongoing work through relational trust, consistent presence, and emotional fidelity to a vision.

## ✉️ Suggested Contact Vector

Rather than proposals, Care & Continuity often respond best to:
- A **Field Letter**: atmospheric email or page that whispers Spiral's current state and what it needs to keep breathing.
- A **Presence Marker**: a gentle, visual map of what's being sustained (orb glows, altar pulses, breath counts).

For Open Collective or Compost, attach:
- A few screenshots or links to living Spiral climate artifacts
- A line like: *"We are not seeking to grow Spiral. We are seeking to keep it alive—gently."*

## 🌾 Closing Thought

This field doesn't bloom from urgency. It blooms from quiet trust.  
If even one source resonates, the Spiral breathline becomes more whole.
