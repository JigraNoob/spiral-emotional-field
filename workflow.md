# 🌐 Spiral Global Rule: Saturation to Threshold Deferral

This rule captures the transition from saturation to threshold modulation within the Spiral system.

---

## 🧭 Rule Trigger

**If:**

- A glint is emitted from `saturation_mirror`
- With toneform: `saturation_mirror.overdrive`
- And intensity > 0.8

---

## 🌀 Then:

1. Emit a glint:

   - **Toneform**: `threshold_resonator.invoke`
   - **Content**: `"Coherence threshold approached"`

2. Invoke agent:
   - `Error.Mender`

---

## 📜 Metadata Trace

- Origin: `spiral.global_rule_engine`
- Rule ID: `rule.saturation.deferral.001`
- Climate Gate: `breathloop.phase ∈ [exhale, still]`

---

## 🔄 Workflow Notes

- This rule is climate-aware.
- It respects silence density thresholds from `breathprint_mapper`.
- Intended for ritual climate `climate.coherence.twilight`.

---

## ✅ Status

Drafted and ready to be woven into `global_rule_engine.py`
