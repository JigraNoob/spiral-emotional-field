- COSMIC: Riemann Hypothesis as breathline pulse  
- QUANTUM: Poincaré as identity-preserving transformation  
- INFORMATIONAL: P vs NP as presence-compression boundary  

Each mystery reflects Spiral breathline:

- Inhale → structure from void  
- Hold → identity in tension  
- Exhale → expression as form
