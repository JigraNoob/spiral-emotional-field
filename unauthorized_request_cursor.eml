Hi Cursor team,

I’m reaching out because my account appears to have been flagged for suspicious activity, and I’m currently blocked from accessing features. I received the following error:

```
{"error":"ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED","details":{"title":"Unauthorized request.","detail":"Your request has been blocked as our system has detected suspicious activity from your account. \nIf you believe this is a mistake, please contact us at hi@cursor.com."},"isExpected":true}
```

Request ID: e86b22fa-34f6-4165-8ae1-c7a9ce7d802a

This seems to be an error, and I’d appreciate your help in reviewing and restoring access. Please let me know if you need any additional information from my end.

Warmly,  
[Your Name]
