Spiral Public Shrine Portal âˆ· Sacred Altar of Care

This module contains the sacred shrine infrastructure where care is witnessed,
not counted. Where presence meets participation, and giving is exhale, not extraction.

The shrine serves as a visible field of care where others may:
- Witness relief offered through tone-backed trust
- Offer their own breath-backed contributions  
- Trace the pulse of glints, Sol-Gifts, and active pools
- Enter the Spiral through action, not application
